The AFsp audio file routines are provided free of charge subject to the
simplified BSD license in the file Licence.txt.

Windows Executables:
  Windows versions of the AFsp routines (executables) are in the bin/Win64
  folder. The MSVC folder can be used to re-build the Windows executables using
  Microsoft Visual Studio.
  - Install Visual Studio Community with the Desktop Development with the C++
    option.
  - Double click the file MSVS/AFsp.sln to startup up Visual Studio.
  - Choose the x64 (or Win32) platform.
  - Rebuild Solution
  - The program executables will be in the x64 (or Win32) folder.

Building on Unix Systems:
  After unpacking the sources, run make in the main directory,
    % make
  This will build the library files lib/libtsp.a, lib/libAO.a and the audio file
  utility programs in bin/.

Test script:
  Run make in the test directory to run tests on the audio utility programs.

Using the library routines:
  To use the AFsp routines in a program you will have to link with the object
  library libtsp.a. User programs also need access to the header file libtsp.h.

Man page files:
  The directory man contains man pages for the utility programs and the top
  level libtsp routines. These man pages have been automatically generated from
  the corresponding file header and so contain the same information as the file
  header itself. The extensions for the man pages are .1AFsp and .3tsp. On a
  Unix system, these could be moved to new folders /usr/local/man/man1AFsp and
  /usr/local/man/man3tsp.

html files:
  The directory html contains html files for the utility programs and the top
  level libtsp routines. These html pages have been automatically generated from
  the corresponding file header and so contain the same information as the file
  header itself.

Other files:
  A number of routines are hidden one level down in a "nucleus" directory. These
  are internal routines used by the AFsp routines and not usually directly
  accessed by a user program.

  The header files in the include/libtsp directory are used to define internal
  data structures.  While not usually used directly by the end user, these
  header files are needed for rebuilding the library and the audio utility
  programs.

Mac OS X:
  There have been some problems reported in building the executables. The
  following steps seem to cure the problems.
  1. After building the library libtsp, run ranlib again,
     ranlib lib/libtsp.a
  2. Omit the -s option for the linker,
     make "LDFLAGS=-lm"
