<tr><th>Input
<td>The input file contains a list of images with temporal and spatial information<br>
for a set of segments. Segments can be video segments (VideoSegment), still regions<br>
(StillRegion), or moving regions (MovingRegion) that can have associated any<br>
number of frames, frames + masks, and frame + masks, respectively. Each image<br>
contains that information as follows. The x-coordinate of the image represents<br>
the frame number; the y-coordinate represents the segment id; and the gray scale<br>
information provides the mask id for the segment in that frame.<br>
The location of the original frames and masks are obtai	ned as follows:<br>
"[input image].dir/f_[frame number].ras"<br>
"[input image].dir/f_[mask id][frame number].ras"<br>
respectively.<br>
Together with this image, each input has a text file describing the hierarchical<br>
relationship between these segments, whose location is "[input image].dir/text.txt"<br>
and whose format is the following:<br>
[Segment id] [Segment type] [Number of children] [children Id's] [Decomposition type]<br>
[gaps?] [overlaps?] [Number of annotations] [Annotation's]<br>
where the decomposition and annotation information are optional.<br>
An example of a well formed input file with three still regions follows:<br>
1 StillRegion 2 2 3 spatial no yes 1 elephant<br>
2 StillRegion 0<br>
3 StillRegion 0
<tr><th>Extraction
<td>Yes
<tr><th>Client Appl
<td>Search & RetrievalSummary<br>
This code generates descriptions of segment trees. This code also allows<br>
to retrieve the segment descriptions based on the the minimum distance between<br>
pairs of segments in the segment trees.
<tr><th>Strong Points
<td>-
<tr><th>Limitations
<td>None
<tr><th>Parameters
<td>None
