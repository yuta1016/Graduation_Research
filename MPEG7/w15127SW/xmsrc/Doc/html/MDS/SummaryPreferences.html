<tr><th>Input
<td>MPEG-7 content description consists of Segments with PointOfView,<br>
MPEG-7 user description with SummaryPreferences as a query
<tr><th>Output
<td>MPEG-7 content description consists of filtered Segments with PointOfView
<tr><th>Extraction
<td>NA
<tr><th>Client Appl
<td>Filtering Application regarding segments filtering
<tr><th>Summary
<td>This component generates content description which consists of the segments that<br>
have user's preferred viewpoints. As an output, this component generates <br>
content description consists of filtered Segment. A summary is generated <br>
dynamically so that a user's preferred time duration and preferred viewpoints<br>
(PreferredSummaryTheme) which are described in SummaryPreferences description <br>
given as a input file may be suited.
<tr><th>Strong Points
<td>User adaptation scalability of content description summarization based on <br>
the combination of viewpoint(s) and time duration which user required. <br>
This summary generator(segment filtering) application can be used as <br>
a scalable multimedia distribution which is adapted to various kind of <br>
user preferences.
<tr><th>Limitations
<td>The input XML file must have at least one or more PreferredSummaryTheme <br>
description(s) with or without SummaryDuration description.<br>
The query XML file must be a MPEG-7 content description which has two or more <br>
Segment descriptions with MediaTime and PointOfView descriptions.
<tr><th>Known Problems
<td>NONE
<tr><th>Parameters
<td>InputXML = Input file name of MPEG-7 user description with SummaryPreferences<br>
   [default: xmlinputfile.xml]<br>
   At least, one PreferredSummaryTheme is needed.<br>
OutputXML = Output file name of MPEG-7 content description based on Segments.<br>
    [default: SummaryPreferencesFiltered.xml]
