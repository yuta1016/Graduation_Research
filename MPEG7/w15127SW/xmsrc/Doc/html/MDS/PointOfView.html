<tr><th>Used Ds/DSs
<td>Reference datatype, TextAnnotation datatype, zeroToOne datatype
<tr><th>Input
<td>MPEG-7 content description consists of Segments with PointOfView, <br>
MPEG-7 user description with SummaryPreferences as a query
<tr><th>Output
<td>MPEG-7 content description based on Summarization
<tr><th>Extraction
<td>NA
<tr><th>Client Appl
<td>Filtering Application regarding segments filtering
<tr><th>Summary
<td>This component generates summary description which consists of the segments that<br>
have user's preferred viewpoints. As an output, this component generates <br>
content description based on Summarization. A summary is generated dynamically <br>
so that a user's preferred time duration and preferred viewpoints<br>
(PreferredSummaryTheme in user description side) which are described in <br>
user description(SummaryPreferences) given as a query parameter may be suited.
<tr><th>Strong Points
<td>User adaptation scalability of summary description generation based on <br>
the combination of viewpoint(s) and time duration which user required. <br>
This summary generator(segment filtering) application can be used as a preprocessor<br>
for the Summarization DS as well as scalable multimedia distribution which is <br>
adapted to various kind of user preferences.
<tr><th>Limitations
<td>The input XML file must have two or more Segment descriptions with MediaTime<br>
and PointOfView descriptions.<br>
The query XML file must be a MPEG-7 user description which has at least one or more<br>
PreferredSummaryTheme description(s) with or without SummaryDuration description.
<tr><th>Known Problems
<td>NONE
<tr><th>Parameters
<td>InputXML = Input file name of MPEG-7 content description with PointOfView<br>
   [default: xmlinputfile.xml]<br>
   At least, Segment, MediaTime and PointOfView descriptions are needed.<br>
OutputXML = Output file name of MPEG-7 content description based on Summarization.<br>
    [default: PointOfViewFiltered.xml]
