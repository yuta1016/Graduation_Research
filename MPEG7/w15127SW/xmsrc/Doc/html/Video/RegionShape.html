<tr><th>Summary
<td>Shape of an object may consist of either single region or a set of regions <br>
as well as some holes in the object in a frame.<br>
The region-based shape descriptor describes shape features of the object <br>
as long as it can be defined by a shape mask. The mask may be binary to contain <br>
holes or multiple disjoint regions within. The mask may also be in gray shade<br>
to distinguish different regions within the object. The descriptor consists <br>
of a set of 35 quantized coefficients of Angular-Radial Transform of an object.
<tr><th>Strong Points
<td>The descriptor is rotational, scale and position invariant. It can deal with <br>
objects with multiple regions including holes in the object.<br>
It is robust to noise along the contour of the object that is common during<br>
the segmentation process of an image, or to shape deformations <br>
due to affine transform. <br>
The descriptor is also characterized by its small size, fast extraction time <br>
and matching. The data size for this representation is fixed to 17.5byte. <br>
The feature extraction and matching processes is straightforward to have <br>
low order of computational complexities, and is suitable for tracking shapes <br>
in the video data processing.
