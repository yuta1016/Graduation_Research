<tr><th>Summary
<td>This is designed to assign a temporal series of visual descriptors into a video segment compactly. This can achieve image to video-frame matching and video-frames to video-frames matching functionalities. Two types of TimeSeries are available: RegularTimeSeries (with constant intervals) and IrregularTimeSeries (with various intervals). This library supports the extraction of both types and their matching (see ClientApplication as an example).
<tr><th>Strong Points
<td>High-speed video segment retrieval. Compact representation of a series of descriptors.
<tr><th>Limitations
<td>Compare descriptions of same TimeSeries type for matching.
<tr><th>Known Problems
<td>none
<tr><th>Parameters
<td>TimeIncr: a default interval between descriptors.
