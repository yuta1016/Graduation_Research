<tr><th>Summary
<td>This library implements the edge histogram descriptor, which is designed to represent the spatial distribution of 5 types of edges in local image regions. It includes both extraction (rectangular and arbitrary shaped) and matching. For the non-normative matching, it includes the semi-global and global histogram matching schemes. For the video segment retrieval, this descriptor should be contained in TimeSeries DS.
<tr><th>Strong Points
<td>Since the edge histogram descriptor consists of local edge histograms only, it is very flexible to represent some global and semi-global edge characteristic for the matching and is also compact.   
<tr><th>Limitations
<td>None<br>
Although our recommendation for the smallest image/object size is 70*70(pixels), this library also works for the images/objects smaller than that by exapnding the image/object size with a bilinear interpoaltion scheme. 
<tr><th>Known Problems
<td>None.
