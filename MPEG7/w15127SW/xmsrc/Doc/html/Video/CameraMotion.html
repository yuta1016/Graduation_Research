<tr><th>Input
<td>Mpeg video stream segments (e.g. foo.mpg[1,1000,25],320,240). The file name of the mpeg video stream is followed<br>
by the segment start frame, the segment end frame, the frame rate (in square brackets), followed by the width<br>
and the height of video frames as shown in the example. 
<tr><th>Extraction
<td>Yes
<tr><th>Client Appl
<td>Search & Retrieval 
<tr><th>Summary
<td>This descriptor characterizes qualitatively and quantitatively camera motion parameters along time (typically along a video segment). <br>
It is based on 3-D camera motion parameter information, which can be automatically extracted or generated by <br>
capture devices.The descriptor supports any combination of the following well-known basic camera operations : <br>
fixed, panning, tracking, tilting, booming, zooming, dollying, and rolling.
<tr><th>Strong Points
<td>As a discriminant feature (motion) of video streams, the camera motion is typically useful in low-level feature-based <br>
retrieval, combined with spatial descriptors such as colour, texture or shape. Could also be used in professional applications.
<tr><th>Limitations
<td>The extraction method implemented in the XM does not allow to discriminate between pans and tracks (rotations and translations)<br>
when the visual field is small (same motion vector fields).
<tr><th>Known Problems
<td>None
<tr><th>Parameters
<td>None?
