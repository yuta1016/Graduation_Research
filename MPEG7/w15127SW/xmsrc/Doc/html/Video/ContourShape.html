<tr><th>Summary
<td>The Contour-based shape descriptor describes shape features of <br>
a closed contour. It uses the curvature scale space representation and<br>
eccentricity and circularity of the original and filtered shape. 
<tr><th>Strong Points
<td>The descriptor is rotational, scale and position invariant. <br>
It is robust to affine shape deformations and deformations <br>
due to non-rigid motion (both very common in video sequences)<br>
The descriptor has good shape generalisation properties,<br>
similar to human perception of visual shapes. It is very compact <br>
(110 bits on average for the MPEG-7 shape database).  
<tr><th>Limitations
<td>Here are some limitations of the current implementation:<br>
Deafult white shape on black background (can be changed)<br>
If more than one contour is in the image, the descripotr is extracted<br>
from the first contour found in the image (upper-left, top left).
<tr><th>Known Problems
<td>None
<tr><th>Parameters
<td>Uses the general XM-SW parameters.
