Type		Application 
External Libraries	ImageMagick library and mpeg2decode with extraction of motion vectors.
Related Ds/DSs	SummaryDS, SequentialSummaryDS, FramePropertyD
Used Ds/DSs	NONE
Input		MPEG-Video (foo.mpg), MPEG frame information file (frameinfo.txt)

		MPEG frame information file is a text file consist of three sections.
		[VideoSkim]  : File name of the video skim file.
		[I-pictures] : Listing of the I-picture frames.
		[P-pictures] : Listing of the P-picture frames.
		[Regions]    : Listing of the frames with region data.

		The syntax for the region data is:
		frame#	imagefile	left	top	width	height
Extraction	Yes
Client Appl	NA
Summary		This component generates a smart quick view, i.e., fast playback with automatic speed 
		control using thumbnail data and frame activity value. The thumbnail data is shrinked 
		I-picture frame images, given by a video skim (a composite of still-images). Frame 
		activity value is calculated from the motion vectors in the P-picture frames. The frame 
		numbers of I and P-pictures have to be described in the frame information file because 
		they are not extracted automaticaly. Region data is used to describe the region of interest.
Strong Points	Regarding speed, it work best when the input mpeg video is not longer than 30 minutes.
Limitations	Processing time can be very long when the input mpeg video is long.
Parameters	NA
