Client Appl	IBMVideoTextEventBrowserDemoForMPEG-7  Application
Summary		The IBM	 videotext extraction algorithm works by extracting and
		analyzing regions in a video frame. The processing stages are
		(i) isolating regions that may contain text characters,
		(ii) separating each character region from its surroundings and
		(iii) verifying the presence of text by consistency analysis across multiple text blocks. 
Strong Points	The extraction algorithm  does very well with low miss
		rates,	by not missing many of the true text lines in the frame
Limitations	NONE
Known Problems	Can't handle images  larger than HDTV resolution
Parameters	The IBMVideoTextServer is coded to handle HDTV frame sizes, 1920x1080.
		Changing MAX_SIZE in IBMVideoTextdataTypes.h can customize this
		and change related constants found in the same file.
