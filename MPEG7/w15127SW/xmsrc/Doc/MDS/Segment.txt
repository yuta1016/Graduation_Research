Input		The input file contains a list of images with temporal and spatial information
 		for a set of segments. Segments can be video segments (VideoSegment), still regions
		(StillRegion), or moving regions (MovingRegion) that can have associated any
 		number of frames, frames + masks, and frame + masks, respectively. Each image
 		contains that information as follows. The x-coordinate of the image represents
 		the frame number; the y-coordinate represents the segment id; and the gray scale
 		information provides the mask id for the segment in that frame.
		The location of the original frames and masks are obtai	ned as follows:
		"[input image].dir/f_[frame number].ras"
		"[input image].dir/f_[mask id][frame number].ras"
		respectively.
		Together with this image, each input has a text file describing the hierarchical
 		relationship between these segments, whose location is "[input image].dir/text.txt"
 		and whose format is the following:
		[Segment id] [Segment type] [Number of children] [children Id's] [Decomposition type]
 		[gaps?] [overlaps?] [Number of annotations] [Annotation's]
		where the decomposition and annotation information are optional.
		An example of a well formed input file with three still regions follows:
		1 StillRegion 2 2 3 spatial no yes 1 elephant
		2 StillRegion 0
		3 StillRegion 0
Extraction	Yes
Client Appl	Search & RetrievalSummary
		This code generates descriptions of segment trees. This code also allows
 		to retrieve the segment descriptions based on the the minimum distance between
		pairs of segments in the segment trees.
