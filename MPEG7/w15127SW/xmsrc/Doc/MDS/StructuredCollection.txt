Input			The input is a text file that describes the classification of M images 
			into N classes with the following format:
			[Number of classes]
			[Class name 1 without spaces]
			[Number of images in the class] [image 1] [image 2] ...
			[Class name 2 without spaces] [Number of images in the class] [image 1] [image 2] ...
			...
			[Class name N without spaces] [Number of images in the class] [image 1] [image 2] ...
			An example of a well formed input file with four classes follows:
			4
			Grass 3 cultu~44_add2.jpg cultu~45_add2.jpg cultu~46_add2.jpg
			Basketball 2 game111_add2.jpg game1191_add2.jpg
			Person 3 i0132_add5.jpg i0122_add5.jpg i8h_add1.jpg
			Dog 1 i8m_add1.jpg
Extraction		Yes
Client Appl		Search & Retrieval
Summary			This code generates collection descriptions with associated probability
			models for each class (sub-collection) in the input and the entire
			collection of M images, and relations among the collections.
			The probability models associated with a collection
			consist of the mean and variance color histogram of the images in the
 			collection. This code also allows to retrieve collection structure descriptions but
 			matching based the closes two collections based on their mean color histogram.
