Input		The input file is identically to the one used in the Segment Application except that
		an additional file Time.txt.
		
		The input file contains an image with temporal and spatial information
 		for a set of segments. Segments are video segments (VideoSegment) that can have 
 		associated any number of frames. The image contains the following information:
 		The x-coordinate of the image represents the frame number; 
 		the y-coordinate represents the segment id;
 		The image is formated as sun rasterfile. Non-black pixel(row, col) represent presence
 		of frame col in segment row. Frame no refers to the true frame no (see below).
		
		Together with this image, each input has a text file (tree.txt) describing the hierarchical
 		relationship between these segments, whose format is the following:
		first line: TimePoint Mode (0=RelTimePoint, 1=RelIncrTimePoint, 2=TimePoint), 
		Duration Mode (0=Duration, 1=IncrDuration)
		following lines:
		<segmentID> <segmentType> <#children> <childIDs> <decompositionType> <overlap> <gap> 
		<segment annotation> 
		segmentType ={VideoSegment, MovingRegion, StillRegion}
    		decompositionType = {temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal}
		where the decomposition and annotation information are optional.
		An example of a well formed input file with three still regions follows:
		1 StillRegion 2 2 3 spatial no yes elephant
		2 StillRegion 0
		3 StillRegion 0
		
 		The time input file Time.txt has the following format:
		frame_rate <framerate_n> <framerate_d> nGOPHeaders <#GOPHeaders> <total #frames>
    		GOP timecode <timecode> nFrames <#frames in GOP>
    		<true frame no> <no. of occurrences>
    		<true frame no> <no. of occurrences>
    		..................................
    		GOP timecode <timecode> nFrames <#frames in GOP>
    		<true frame no> <no. of occurrences>
    		..............................
    		
    		Note: true frame no refers to the frame no wrt frame rate of the video sequence 
	 	before encoding hence, skipped frames has occurences of 0; normal frames 1; 
	 	repeated frames 2/3.
	 	
	 	For the query application a query input file according to the following foramt has to be used:
	 	starttime in sec> <starttime in nn> <duration in sec> <duration in nn> <nnFraction>
		Note: starttime in nn and duration in nn both have a range of [0, nnFraction-1]
	 			
		
Extraction	Yes
Client Appl	Search & Retrieval
		This code generates descriptions of segment trees. This code also allows
 		to retrieve the segment descriptions based on the the minimum distance between
		pairs of segments in the segment trees.
