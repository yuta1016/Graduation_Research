External Libraries	NONE
Related Ds/DSs	SegmentDS, MediaTimeDS, SummaryPreferencesDS
Used Ds/DSs	Reference datatype, TextAnnotation datatype, zeroToOne datatype
Input		MPEG-7 content description consists of Segments with PointOfView, 
		MPEG-7 user description with SummaryPreferences as a query
Output		MPEG-7 content description based on Summarization
Extraction	NA
Client Appl	Filtering Application regarding segments filtering
Summary		This component generates summary description which consists of the segments that
		have user's preferred viewpoints. As an output, this component generates 
		content description based on Summarization. A summary is generated dynamically 
		so that a user's preferred time duration and preferred viewpoints
		(PreferredSummaryTheme in user description side) which are described in 
		user description(SummaryPreferences) given as a query parameter may be suited.
Strong Points	User adaptation scalability of summary description generation based on 
		the combination of viewpoint(s) and time duration which user required. 
		This summary generator(segment filtering) application can be used as a preprocessor
		for the Summarization DS as well as scalable multimedia distribution which is 
		adapted to various kind of user preferences.
Limitations	The input XML file must have two or more Segment descriptions with MediaTime
		and PointOfView descriptions.
		The query XML file must be a MPEG-7 user description which has at least one or more
		PreferredSummaryTheme description(s) with or without SummaryDuration description.
Known Problems	NONE
Parameters	InputXML = Input file name of MPEG-7 content description with PointOfView
			   [default: xmlinputfile.xml]
			   At least, Segment, MediaTime and PointOfView descriptions are needed.
		OutputXML = Output file name of MPEG-7 content description based on Summarization.
			    [default: PointOfViewFiltered.xml]
