Summary	This component generates a Fast Moving Storyboard(FMSB), i.e., a slide show synchronized with a speed up version of the audio track. It uses an implementation the Window Synchronized Overlap Add method (WSOLA). WSOLA is a time scaling algorithm that preserves pitch and timbre.
Strong Points	Regarding speed, it work best when the input sampling rate is not higher than 11kHz As a by product, this component generates a SMIL file that can be played with VideoCharger(IBM), QuickTime, RealPlayer Sample SMIL file included in M6540.
Limitations	The input audio file must be a)Linear PCM, compressed WAV audio is not supported b)16 bits per sample (signed). The output wave file is MONO, even if the input wave file is stereo. Processing time can be  very  long when the input sampling rate is high (44 Khz for example).
Known Problems	At the moment the generated audio has a fixed speed up factor. An input parameter can be added to indicate the factor. The algorithm used can generated slowed down audio.
