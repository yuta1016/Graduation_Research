Input			The input file contains a list of images with temporal and spatial information 
			for a set of segments. Segments can be video segments (VideoSegment), still regions
			(StillRegion), or moving regions (MovingRegion) that can have associated any
 			number of frames, frames + masks, and frame + masks, respectively. Each image 
			contains that information as follows. The x-coordinate of the image represents
 			the frame number; the y-coordinate represents the segment id; and the gray scale
 			information provides the mask id for the segment in that frame.
 			The location of the original frames and masks are obtained as follows:
			"[input image].dir/f_[frame number].ras"
			"[input image].dir/f_[mask id][frame number].ras"
			respectively.
			Together with this image, each input has a text file describing the hierarchical
 			relationship between these segments, whose location is "[input image].dir/text.txt"
 			and whose format is the following:
			[Segment id] [Segment type] [Number of children] [children Id's] [Decomposition type]
			[gaps?] [overlaps?] [Number of annotations] [Annotation's]
			where the decomposition and annotation information are optional.
			An example of a well formed input file with three still regions follows:
			1 StillRegion 2 2 3 spatial no yes 1 elephant
			2 StillRegion 0
			3 StillRegion 0
Extraction		Yes
Client Appl		Search & Retrieval
Summary			This code generates descriptions of temporal segment graphs including the following
			normative binary temporal relations: before, starts and after. This code also allows
			to retrieve the segment graph descriptions based on the segment relations and
			their order in the description.
