Summary		Shape of an object may consist of either single region or a set of regions 
		as well as some holes in the object in a frame.
		The region-based shape descriptor describes shape features of the object 
		as long as it can be defined by a shape mask. The mask may be binary to contain 
		holes or multiple disjoint regions within. The mask may also be in gray shade
		to distinguish different regions within the object. The descriptor consists 
		of a set of 35 quantized coefficients of Angular-Radial Transform of an object.

Strong Points	The descriptor is rotational, scale and position invariant. It can deal with 
		objects with multiple regions including holes in the object.
		It is robust to noise along the contour of the object that is common during
		the segmentation process of an image, or to shape deformations 
		due to affine transform. 
		The descriptor is also characterized by its small size, fast extraction time 
		and matching. The data size for this representation is fixed to 17.5byte. 
		The feature extraction and matching processes is straightforward to have 
		low order of computational complexities, and is suitable for tracking shapes 
		in the video data processing. 
Limitations	None
Known Problems	None
