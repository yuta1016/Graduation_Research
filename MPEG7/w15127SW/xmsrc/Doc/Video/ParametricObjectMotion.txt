Summary		Parametric Motion describes the global or object motion in video over a certain period of time, by a set of parameters according to a certain motion models. Different motion models, spatial and temporal references can be used, enabling high flexibility of possible descriptions. In addition to query-by-example (i.e. retrieving motions that are similar to a given example) it also enables query-by-specification of certain kinds of motion, like "find left translation" or "find up-scales (zoom)".
Strong Points	none
Limitations	none
Known Problems	none
Parameters	Uses the general XM-SW parameters. In the listfile image pairs
		must be specified that define the motion in between:
		motion_1_image_1
		motion_1_image_2
		motion_2_image_1
		motion_2_image_2
			:
		motion_N_image_1
		motion_N_image_2
