Summary		This is designed to assign a temporal series of visual descriptors into a video segment compactly. This can achieve image to video-frame matching and video-frames to video-frames matching functionalities. Two types of TimeSeries are available: RegularTimeSeries (with constant intervals) and IrregularTimeSeries (with various intervals). This library supports the extraction of both types and their matching (see ClientApplication as an example).
Strong Points	High-speed video segment retrieval. Compact representation of a series of descriptors.
Limitations	Compare descriptions of same TimeSeries type for matching.
Known Problems	none
Parameters	AddtParamListFile: additional parameters for each video including frame ratem time interval, time offset and duration. DescriptorID: the ID of visual descriptor (only Color Layout is supported (DescriptorID=2)
