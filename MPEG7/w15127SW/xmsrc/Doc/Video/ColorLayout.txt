Related Ds/DSs	Still Region DS, Video Segment DS, Moving Object Ds, TimeSeries DS
Used Ds/DSs	none
Input	Images
Extraction	Yes
Client Appl	Search & Retrieval
Summary	Color Layout is designed to achieve very high-speed retrieval of images or video frames based on the spatial distribution of color. This library supports both extraction (rectangular and arbitrary shaped) and matching (see ClientApplication as an example). To implement the video segment retrieval functionality, this descriptor should be contained in TimeSeries DS (see TimeSeries DS).
Strong Points	High-speed image and video segment retrieval.Very compact representation of annotation data.(request only 8 Bytes for each image)
Limitations	None. The components had been tested using over 50,000 digital photos.
Known Problems	none
Parameters	Color Layout descriptor supports scalable representation of spatial distribution of color. If you wish to change the number of coefficients, you should directly modify the parameters of StartExtraction()
