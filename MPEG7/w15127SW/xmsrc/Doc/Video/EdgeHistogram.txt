Summary		This library implements the edge histogram descriptor, which is designed to represent the spatial distribution of 5 types of edges in local image regions. It includes both extraction (rectangular and arbitrary shaped) and matching. For the non-normative matching, it includes the semi-global and global histogram matching schemes. For the video segment retrieval, this descriptor should be contained in TimeSeries DS.
Strong Points	Since the edge histogram descriptor consists of local edge histograms only, it is very flexible to represent some global and semi-global edge characteristic for the matching and is also compact.   
Limitations	None
		Although our recommendation for the smallest image/object size is 70*70(pixels), this library also works for the images/objects smaller than that by exapnding the image/object size with a bilinear interpoaltion scheme. 
Known Problems	None.
Parameters	None.
