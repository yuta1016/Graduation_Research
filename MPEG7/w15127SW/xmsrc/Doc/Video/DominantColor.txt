Summary		The dominant color descriptor is useful for image and video retrieval. It targets content-based retrieval for color, either for the whole image or for any arbitrary shaped region (rectangular or irregular). It is a very compact descriptor, requiring less than 6-8 colors per region. Since colors are not pre-quantized as in the histogram type color descriptors, the representation is more accurate. To accomplish high accuracy in retrieval, Spatial Coherency and/or Color Variance can be utilized. It is intended for applications that use object based representations (objects or regions in an image).	 
Limitations	The maximum allowed number of dominant colors is 8.
Known Problems	None.
Parameters	color space and color quantization parameters
