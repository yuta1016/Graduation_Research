External Libraries	none
Related Ds/DSs	ContourShapeD, RegionShapeD, StillRegionDS (rectangular and arbitrarily shaped)
Used Ds/DSs	MultipleView D, ContourShapeD, RegionShapeD
Input		Number of Images (up to 16), originating from 3D object
Extraction	Yes
Client Appl	Search & Retrieval
Summary	Multiple View (as a container descriptor) uses the underlying Descriptor, e.g. ContourShape for 
		Extraction and Retrieval of similar objects. Two retrieval methods are available: 3D-3D Retrieval, 
		where a number of views from one object is compared to a number of views from the database 
		objects and 2D-3D Retrieval, where a 2D-image is compared to the most similar views of the 3D-object
Strong Points	Depends on the underlying Descriptor
Limitations	Only up to 16 views per object are supported
Known Problems	None
Parameters	Uses the general XM-SW parameters, IMPORTANT: The list file should only contain the name of the original 3D object without extension, e.g. "c:\temp\model-1". The extensions for the views are appended automatically by the program. The convention is to name the 2D-views from that model "model-1_1.gif", "model-1_2.gif" up to "model-1_16.gif"
