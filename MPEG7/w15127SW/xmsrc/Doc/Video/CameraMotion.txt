Input			Mpeg video stream segments (e.g. foo.mpg[1,1000,25],320,240). The file name of the mpeg video stream is followed
				by the segment start frame, the segment end frame, the frame rate (in square brackets), followed by the width
				and the height of video frames as shown in the example. 
Extraction		Yes
Client Appl		Search & Retrieval 
Summary			This descriptor characterizes qualitatively and quantitatively camera motion parameters along time (typically along a video segment). 
			It is based on 3-D camera motion parameter information, which can be automatically extracted or generated by 
			capture devices.The descriptor supports any combination of the following well-known basic camera operations : 
			fixed, panning, tracking, tilting, booming, zooming, dollying, and rolling.
Strong Points		As a discriminant feature (motion) of video streams, the camera motion is typically useful in low-level feature-based 
			retrieval, combined with spatial descriptors such as colour, texture or shape. Could also be used in professional applications.
Limitations		The extraction method implemented in the XM does not allow to discriminate between pans and tracks (rotations and translations)
			when the visual field is small (same motion vector fields).
Known Problems		None
Parameters		None?
