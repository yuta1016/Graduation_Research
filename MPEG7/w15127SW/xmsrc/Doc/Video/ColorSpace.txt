Summary		This descriptor specifies the color space that is to be used in other color based descriptions. In the current description, the following color spaces are supported:
		- RGB
		- YCbCr
		- HSV
		- HMMD
		- Linear transformation matrix with reference to RGB
		- Monochrome
		Color transform modules provided in extraction (ColorSpaceExtraction.cpp) are as follows:
		-YUV(YCbCr) to HSV
		-YUV(YCbCr) to RGB
		-RGB to YUV(YCbCr)
		-RGB to HSV	
		-HSV to RGB
		-RGB to HMMD
		-HMMD to RGB	 
Limitations	Currently, the descriptor specifies only limited number of color spaces which are RGB, YCbCr, HSV, HMMD, Linear transformation matrix with reference to RGB and Monochrome.
Known Problems	None.
