Summary		The Perceptual 3D Shape Descriptor provides a compact shape description of 3D data represented as 3D meshes. 
		The Perceptual 3D Shape Descriptor is generated from the part-based representation. It has the form of 
		an attributed relational graph (ARG), composed of nodes and edges. A node represents a meaningful part 
		of the model with unary attributes, while an edge implies binary relations between nodes.
Strong Points	Compactness
Limitations	NONE
Known Problems	NONE
Parameters	bits_per_attribute: the number of bits used for quantizing the descriptor values. Default value is 8 bits.
