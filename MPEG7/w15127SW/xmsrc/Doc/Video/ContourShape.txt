Summary		The Contour-based shape descriptor describes shape features of 
		a closed contour. It uses the curvature scale space representation and
		eccentricity and circularity of the original and filtered shape. 
Strong Points	The descriptor is rotational, scale and position invariant. 
		It is robust to affine shape deformations and deformations 
		due to non-rigid motion (both very common in video sequences)
		The descriptor has good shape generalisation properties,
		similar to human perception of visual shapes. It is very compact 
		(110 bits on average for the MPEG-7 shape database).  
Limitations	Here are some limitations of the current implementation:
		Deafult white shape on black background (can be changed)
		If more than one contour is in the image, the descripotr is extracted
		from the first contour found in the image (upper-left, top left).
Known Problems	None
Parameters	Uses the general XM-SW parameters.
