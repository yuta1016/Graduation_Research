*******************   Some helping words for XM-Integration of the Matlab-Code   *********************


1. Within these Subfolders one will find the Matlab Extraction Code
   for the AudioFramework sorted by Descriptor-Names.

2. Some of the folders include zip-Files with more utilities than needed, 
   but each of the matlab-functions are named respectively have an editor's note about
   which subroutines are used.

3. As an example IRCAM provided code to make a function call out of the XM to their
   Matlab-Functions, which should work with use of respsctive Matalab-Libraries.
   This is already realized for TemporalCentroidD, LogAttackTimeD, HarmonicSpectralVariationD,
   HarmonicSpectralSpreadD, HarmonicSpectralDeviationD, HarmonicSpectralCentroidD and
   AudioSpectrumSpreadD. All the other extraction utilities should be integrated in the same manner.

4. For code specific questions please contact the editors themselves, who are named in their
   contributions.
