To Compile in Windows:
1. The Project workspaces have been included for both the encoder and the decoder.

2. While compiling it is necessary to give the path where the Xerces.dsp file is located in your system/or where the XercesLib dll resides    (ie the xerces-c_1_5_1D.dll).
   This is the latest version of the xerces dll used which had schema support.
   This can be downloaded from the xml.apache.org site (http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/install.html)
   Download the latest release 1.5.1 which has the schema support.
