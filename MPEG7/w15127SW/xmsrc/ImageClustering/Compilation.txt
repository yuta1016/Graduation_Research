Required libraries for the MPEG-7 eXperimentation Model (XM) clustering software

- ImageMagick (for loading and storing visual data)
  You need the C-API (magick) of ImageMagick. A frozen version which is know
  to work OK is available on the web Server. Currently, this version is
  4.2.*. However, It is also known that the the XM compiles with
  version 5.2.*. Some other versions are not easily usable.
   
- Xerces (the XML parser)
  some distributions supporting the DOM-API are available. On the web
  server you can find the Apache xerces parser (version 1_6) which is
  proofed to work fine with the XM and its other executables.

- On Unix you must check the paths in the Makefile.

- The dsp file for Win32 is configured to have the library directories next
  to the newsrc directory, i.e., a dir command will return

  > dir
  ImageMagick
  newsrc
  xml

  The directories for the headers files are set to:
    ImageMagick/magick (the setting is ImageMagick without /magick)
    xml/include or xml/src

  The directories for the libraries are set to:
    ImageMagick/lib (here are the static libraries)
    ImageMagick/bin (here you can find the dll's, don't forget to set the
      search path in the autoexec.bat file)
    xml/lib (static and dynamic lib's, copy the files from
      xml/Build/Win32/VC6/Release to this location and
      don't forget to set the search path in the autoexec.bat file)


**************************************************
Compiling the XM for Unix

- Open the Makefile and adjust the settings to your environment.
  - select the the OS
  - enable or disable the external libraries (this is section one
    of the Makefile)
  - adjust the setting for the external libraries (this is section two
    of the Makefile)
  - select the compiler and other compilation tools (this is
    section three of the Makefile)
    Note: for compilation a C++ compiler supporting name spaces is
          required (e.g., gcc incl. egcs; usually version 2.9* is fine)
  - enable ("y") or disable the MPEG-7 modules to be compiled into
    XM software (in section 4)
- run "make"
- create a soft-link from XMMain_yoursettings.exe to XMMain.exe
  (e.g., yoursettings can be linux_dbg)


***************************************************
Compiling the XM on Win32

- compilation is know to work using Visual C++ 6.0 (support for name
  spaces is required)
- open the work space file XMWinExe.dsw
- select the XMWinExe module to be compiled
- press F7 for compilation
- rename the resulting XMWinExe.exe file to XMMain.exe (sorry this OS
  does not support file system links)


**************************************************

Note: the clustering program exists in parallel with the "main" XM and
reuses most of the same code; however, to avoid any potential conflicts,
separate versions of the libraries are be built by the Unix Makefile
and Win32 MSVC++ project files (*.dsp).
